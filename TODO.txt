Think about adding an '-abs' parameter, which will convert all vectors to
absolute values during load. This may replace the Histogram -abs parameter.

Performance and memory improvements:
- Currently position-data is duplicated for each component. This made support
  for multiple components in the .vec format easy. Would be a good idea to
  implement a more efficient way...
